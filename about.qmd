## About me

I am a public health professional with years of experience working on Tobacco Control both nationally and Globally. I am currently pursuing my DrPH and preparing to write my dissertation. I am hopeful this course will help me get organized and support my data analysis skill for my dissertation and beyond.

This is my first time diving into R. My past experiences has been a little bit of SAS, SPSS and STATA all at different points in my career. GitHub, Quarto, Gitkraken are all new to me and I cant say I am not intimidated.

In my quest to understand this very first module, I found a youtube video that was very useful to me, hope it can be useful to you too!
